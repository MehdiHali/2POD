# Podapter: Scalable and Automated Podcast Generation

This project is an open source audio management and podcast generation and hosting solution. Unlike other podcast hosting platforms, our application will make gathering and organizing audio content from different sources from the web and redelivering them through podcasts, as easy as a click of a button. Massive amount of audio content is being hosted on the web unorganized, and the goal of our application is to gather it, organize it, and redeliver it in a more convenient way through podcasts.

Our solution is a web based application, that enable users to scrap audio content from various websites like Youtube and Soundcloud, organize it using labels and redistribute it as podcasts. An embedded audio player is included for listening to podcasts from inside of the app. We also let the option to the user to either buy cloud storage to host his content, or use our unique stateless streaming on demande approach without any additional storage space required. A main shared instance of the application will be deployed and hosted by us, while the app is open source and can be self hosted.
